# Demo programs

This directory contains all the examples mentioned by Peter Seibel in Chapter 19 of his book, [Practical Common Lisp](http://gigamonkeys.com/book/).

Namely:

1. [DoesNothing](appDoesNothing.php) – silently ignores all errors.
2. [QuitsIfMany](appQuitsIfMany.php) – exits if some number of errors have occurred.  (In this example, three errors.)
3. [FakesEntry](appFakesEntry.php) – flags the entry as corrupted in the data structure.
4. [WarnsUser](appWarnsUser.php) – raises a warning message.
